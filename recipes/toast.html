        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This orange french toast bake is a fresh twist on a breakfast classic that is bursting with subtle citrus flavor, a perfect recipe if you're feeding a large group.</p>
        <p>You're not standing at a stove frying french toast, and everything comes out of the oven, hot and ready to serve at once.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup Triple Sec or other orange liqueur</li>
            <li>½ fresh orange, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon orange extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>12 slices cinnamon raisin bread</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon confectioners sugar, or as needed(optional)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons warm maple syrup, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375℉ (190℃). Lightly grease two large baking sheets or line with parchment paper, lightly sprayed with cooking spray, which will keep the bread from sticking.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk eggs until light in color. Add milk, sugar, orange liqueur, orange juice, orange zest, orange extract, salt, and nutmeg, whisk until well combined.</li>
            <li>Coat bread slices in the egg custard, and place on the baking sheets without overlapping. Bake until golden brown, flipping halfway through baking time, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>To serve, sprinkle with confectioners sugar and dizzle with mapple syrup.</li>
        </ol>
